# Sudoku-Solver-on-Lua
A code in Lua54 that can solve sudoku game for any size

Insert your sudoku in "sudokuinput.txt"
Use numbers and underscore for blanks spaces
Make sure to give a space between cells

After inputting your sudoku, execute the "run.bat" file, feel free to change the code of it if it doesn't work

In the "sudokuexamples.txt" there are a bunch of sudoku presets

The source code sure is messy, and I don't plan on organizing it at all haha (I made this project just to challenge myself)

If you find any bugs, feel free to fix them!
